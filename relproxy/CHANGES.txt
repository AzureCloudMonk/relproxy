 RELEASE CHANGES

* 0.8.2 (UNPUBLISHED)

    - Optimization: method JProxyInputSourceFileExcludedListener.isExcluded(File file,File) is called being parameter file also a directory, if the directory is fully
      excluded, RelProxy doesn't call isExcluded for files into the folder. Useful for big source code bases and used RelProxy for normal source code folders.
    - Reload using a new ClassLoader is done when calling the exposed methods of the singletons registered on JProxy.
    - Removed JPROXYSH_SCAN_PERIOD, has no sense in shell scripting.
    - Bug fix in case of paths with spaces in JProxy
    - Bug fix in case of ".." in paths in JProxy
    - Manual has been very improved documenting new features and new chapters.
